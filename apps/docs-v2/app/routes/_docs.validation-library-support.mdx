# Validation Library Support

There are official adapters available for `zod`, `yup` and `valibot`,
but you can easily support whatever library you want by creating your own adapter.

And if you create an adapter for a library, feel free to make a PR to add official support 😊

## Creating an adapter

In order to make an adapter for your validation library of choice,
you can create a function that accepts a schema from the validation library and turns it into a validator using `createValidator`.
For more on this you can check the implementations for `withZod`, `withYup` and `withValibot`.

The out-of-the-box support for `yup` in this library works like this:

```ts
export const withYup = <Schema extends AnyObjectSchema>(
  validationSchema: Schema,
  // For best result with Typescript,
  // we should type the `Validator`
  // we return based on the provided schema
): Validator<InferType<Schema>> =>
  createValidator({
    validate: async (unvalidatedData) => {
      // Validate with yup and return the
      // validated & typed data or the error

      if (isValid)
        return {
          data: { field1: "someValue" },
          error: undefined,
        };
      else
        return {
          error: { field1: "Some error!" },
          data: undefined,
        };
    },
  });
```
