# Controlled fields

Sometimes you have a component that _isn't_ a native form control.
Those cases are really straigthforward to handle with RVF.

## Simple cases

<Row>
  <Col>
    For many controlled components, you can simply spread `getControlProps` onto the component.
    In order for a component to support this, it needs to:

    - Accept a `ref` to a focusable HTML element.
      - **This is important!** -- if you omit this, RVF will try to manage the field like an uncontrolled field.
    - Have `onChange` and `onBlur` handlers.
    - Accept a `value` prop.
    - Optionally, can accept a `name` prop

  </Col>
  <Col>
  
    ```tsx
    const form = useForm({
      // ...etc
    });

    return (
      <form {...form.getFormProps()}>
        <MyControlledInput {...form.getControlProps("myField")} />
      </form>
    )
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>

<Row>
  <Col>
    If your controlled component renders a native form control with the provided `name` prop,
    or if you're exclusively using [state mode](/state-mode), then that's all you need to do.
    
    If that isn't the case, you'll also need to serialize the value into a hidden input
    in order for the value to appear in the forms `FormData`.
    Fortunately, there's a `getHiddenInputProps` helper to help with that.

  </Col>
  <Col>
  
    ```tsx
    const form = useForm({
      // ...etc
    });
    
    const field = form.field("myField");

    return (
      <form {...form.getFormProps()}>
        <MyControlledInput {...field.getControlProps()} />
        <input
          type="hidden"
          {...field.getHiddenInputProps({
            // If you leave out `serialize`, RVF will assume the value is already a string
            serialize: val => JSON.stringify(val),
          })}
        />
      </form>
    );
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>

## More complicated cases

If simply spreading `getControlProps` isn't enough for your use-case,
the [`FieldApi`](/reference/field-api) exposes all the tools you need to wire up your component manually.

The key APIs to look at are:

- [`refs.controlled`](/reference/field-api#refs)
- [`onChange`](/reference/field-api#on-change)
- [`onBlur`](/reference/field-api#on-blur)
- [`value`](/reference/field-api#value)
