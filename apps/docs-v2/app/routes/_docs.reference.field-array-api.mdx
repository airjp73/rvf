# `FieldArrayApi`

The `FieldArrayApi` provides helpers for interacting with field arrays.

## `FieldApi` methods

### `map`

<Row>
  <Col>
    Maps over the items in the array and renders them.
    Your map function will receive the following arguments:

    - `key`: A unique string key you can use as the `key` prop when rendering the list of items.
      When you have your own key available (like the `id` of an item), it's recommended to use that instead.
    - `item`: A [`FormApi`](/reference/form-api) scoped to that item in the array.
    - `index`: The index of the item in the array.

  </Col>

  <Col>

    ```tsx
    myArray.map((key, item, index) => (
      <div key={key}>
        {item.value("name")}
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() => {
            myArray.remove(index);
          }}
        >
          Delete
        </button>
      </div>
    ));
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>

### `error`

Returns the array-level error message, if there is one.
This is commonly something along the lines of "Must have at least one item".

### `length`

Returns the length of the array.

```typescript
const length = myArray.length();
```

### `name`

Returns the name of the field.

```typescript
const name = myArray.name();
```

### `push`

Adds an item to the end of the array.

```typescript
myArray.push({ name: "New item" });
```

### `pop`

Removes the last item in the array.

```typescript
myArray.pop();
```

### `shift`

Removes the first item in the array.

```typescript
myArray.shift();
```

### `unshift`

Adds an item to the start of the array.

```typescript
myArray.unshift({ name: "New item" });
```

### `insert`

Inserts an item at a specific index in the array.

```typescript
myArray.insert(1, { name: "New item" });
```

### `move`

Moves an item from `fromIndex` to `toIndex` in the array.
This process happens by removing the item at `fromIndex` and inserting it at `toIndex`.
Keep this in mind if your `toIndex` is after the `fromIndex`.

```typescript
myArray.move(0, 1);
```

### `swap`

Swaps the items at `fromIndex` and `toIndex`.

```typescript
myArray.swap(0, 1);
```

### `remove`

Removes an item at the given index from the array.

```typescript
myArray.remove(1);
```

### `replace`

Replaces an item in the array.

```typescript
myArray.replace(1, { name: "New item" });
```

### `errorFocusElement`

Normally, when a user submits a form and it contains validation error,
the first invalid element in the form will be focused.
Pass this ref to a focusable element to simulate this behavior when there are array-level errors
for this field array.
