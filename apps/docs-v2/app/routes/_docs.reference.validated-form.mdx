# `ValidatedForm`

`ValidatedForm` is a thin wrapper around `useForm` that lets you use RVF as a component instead of a hook.
You can use it with a render prop to get access to the [`FormApi`](/reference/form-api) object.

## Behavior differences

`ValidatedForm` automatically connects your form with [`getFormProps`](/reference/form-api#get-form-props)
and automatically calls [`renderFormIdInput`](/reference/form-api#render-form-id-input).

## Additional props

The props are all the same as the [`FormOpts` passed to `useForm`](/reference/use-form#form-opts),
except with the following additions:

### `formRef`

A ref to the form element.

### `children`

A render prop that accepts a `FormApi` object.
Or just normal react children.
