# `useForm`

`useForm` is the main hook that you'll use to interact with RVF.
It accepts a `FormOpts` object you use to configure the form (see below),
and returns a `FormApi` object that you can use to interact with the form (see [FormApi](/reference/form-api)).

### Type

```tsx
function useForm<
  FormInputData extends FieldValues,
  FormOutputData,
  SubmitResponseData,
>(
  options: FormOpts<FormInputData, FormOutputData, SubmitResponseData>,
): FormApi<FormInputData>;
```

### Usage

```tsx
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: { foo: "bar" },
  validator: myValidator,
  handleSubmit: (validatedData) => console.log(validatedData),
});
```

## `FormOpts`

### `defaultValues`

Sets the default values of the form.

For Typescript users, `defaultValues` is one of the most important props you'll use.
The type of the object you pass here, will determine the type of the data you get
when interacting with the form. For example, `form.value('myField')` will be typed based on
the type of `defaultValues.myField`.

It's recommended that you provide a default value for every field in the form.

### `validator`

A validator object created by a validation adapter such a `withZod` or `withYup`.
See [these docs](https://rvf-js.io/validation-library-support) for more details
and information on how to create a validator for other validation libraries.

### `submitSource`

Configures what RVF uses as the source of truth for form validation submission.
By default, this is set to `"dom"`, which means RVF will pull data directly out of the HTML form element.
If you set this to `"state"`, RVF will use the data stored in the form state as the source of truth.
You can read more about state mode [here](/state-mode).

### `handleSubmit`

A function that is called when the form is submitted, if the data is valid.
Depending on the `submitSource` you chose, this function will be called with different arguments.

#### "dom"

```ts
(data: FormInputData, formData: FormData, options: SubmitterOptions) => void | Promise<void>
```

- `data` is the fully validated form data.
- `formData` is the raw `FormData` extracted from the HTML form element.
- `options` is an object that contains a few props pulled off of the submitter of the form (usually the sumbit button).

#### "state"

```ts
(data: FormInputData, options: SubmitterOptions) => void | Promise<void>
```

- `data` is the fully validated form data.
- `options` is an object that contains a few props pulled off of the submitter of the form (usually the sumbit button).

### `onSubmitSuccess`

Called after the form has been successfully submitted with whatever data was returned from the `handleSubmit` function.
Can be useful for showing a toast message or redirecting the user to a different page.
If you return a `Promise` from this callback, the `isSubmitting` state will still be `true` while this callback is running.

### `onSubmitFailure`

Called when the `handleSubmit` function throws an error.
Can be useful for showing a toast message or redirecting the user to a different page.
If you return a `Promise` from this callback, the `isSubmitting` state will still be `true` while this callback is running.

### `resetAfterSubmit`

A shortcut setting that resets the form to the default values after the form has been successfully submitted.
This is equivalent to calling `resetForm` in the `onSubmitSuccess` callback.

### `validationBehaviorConfig`

Allows you to customize the validation behavior of the form.
Takes three options:

- `initial` - When the form first mounts, when should the validation be triggered?
- `whenTouched` - Once a given field has been touched, when should the validation be triggered?
- `whenSubmitted` - Once the form has been submitted unnsuccessfully, when should the validation be triggered?

### `action`

The action prop of the form element.
This will be automatically set on the form element if you use `getFormProps`.

### `id`

The id of the form element.
This will be automatically set on the form element if you use `getFormProps`.

### `disableFocusOnError`

Disables the default behavior of focusing the first invalid field when a submit fails due to validation errors.

### `reloadDocument`

When set to true, a valid form will be submitted natively with a full page reload.
_Note_: This is only supported in the `dom` submit source.

### `otherFormProps`

Optionally, you can pass other props to the form element here.
This is primarily useful for writing custom hooks around `useForm`.
For most use-cases, you can simply pass the props directly to the form element.

### `serverValidationErrors`

Can be used to set the default errors of the entire form.
This is most useful went integrating with server-side validation.

**CAREFUL**: this will cause an update every time the identity of `serverValidationErrors` changes.
So make sure the identity of `serverValidationErrors` is stable.
