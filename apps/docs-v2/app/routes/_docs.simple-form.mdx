# A simple form

Let's start with a simple form that uses only the native form APIs
to see how we can easily start enhancing it with RVF.

<SimpleForm />

Notice how much we have to:

- Manually pull all the data out of the form
- Manually validate that the passwords match in three different places
- Manually call `setCustomValidity` and `reportValidity` on the confirm password input
- Manually manage a loading state

## Simplifying with RVF

Now let's add just a little bit of RVF.

<SimpleFormRvf />

We've only saved a few lines of code, but the code is much less manual and more organized.
Now we

- Get the data directly in our submit handler
- Get to keep our existing, native validations via the `required` prop.
- Get our custom validation run automatically at the right time
- Don't have to call `setCustomValidity` and `reportValidity` directly
- Don't have to manage a loading state

And we didn't have to call `register` or `useField` or use a `Field` component or anything.
Just `useForm`, some native validations, and `useNativeValidity` for an extra custom error.
