# Validation Library Support

RVF is supports [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) out of the box,
so you can use any compatible validation library with no adapter.
Some of these include:

- Zod
- Valibot
- ArkType
- Effect Schema
- [And more](https://standardschema.dev/)

There's also an official adapter for `yup`. Install `@rvf/yup` if you want to use `yup`.

## Creating an adapter

If you use a validation library that doesn't implement Standard Schema,
and doesn't have an official adapter, you can make one yourself.

<Note>
  The approach outlined here uses the legacy `createValidator` api.
  If you're able to, we recommend creating an adapter to turn the schema into a Standard Schema.
  You might also be able to raise a feature request to add Standard Schema support to that library.

  However, this option will remain open until we have documentation on how to do that.
</Note>


In order to make an adapter for your validation library of choice,
you can create a function that accepts a schema from the validation library and turns it into a validator using `createValidator`.
For more on this you can check the implementations for `withYup`.

The out-of-the-box support for `yup` in this library works like this:

```ts
export const withYup = <Schema extends AnyObjectSchema>(
  validationSchema: Schema,
  // For best result with Typescript,
  // we should type the `Validator`
  // we return based on the provided schema
): Validator<InferType<Schema>> =>
  createValidator({
    validate: async (unvalidatedData) => {
      // Validate with yup and return the
      // validated & typed data or the error

      if (isValid)
        return {
          data: { field1: "someValue" },
          error: undefined,
        };
      else
        return {
          error: { field1: "Some error!" },
          data: undefined,
        };
    },
  });
```
