This was previously the Remix adapter.
Since Remix v3 has merged with React Router v7, we now only have a React Router adapter.

## Server-side validation

One of the core features of this library is that you can re-use your validation on the server.
Let's use this schema as an example:

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
  firstName: z
    .string()
    .min(1, { message: "First name is required" }),
  lastName: z
    .string()
    .min(1, { message: "Last name is required" }),
  email: z
    .string()
    .min(1, { message: "Email is required" })
    .email("Must be a valid email"),
});
```

All you need to do is call `parseFormData` with the request and the schema.

```tsx
export const action = async ({
  request,
}: DataFunctionArgs) => {
  const result = await parseFormData(request, schema);

  if (result.error) {
    // validationError comes from `@rvf/react-router`
    return validationError(
      result.error,
      result.submittedData,
    );
  }

  const { firstName, lastName, email } = result.data;
  // Do something with the data
};
```

When we use the `validationError` to return our validation errors,
the `useForm` or `ValidatedForm` in our route component will automatically pick up those errors.
If you also pass `result.submittedData` to as the second argument to `validationError`,
it will automatically repopulate the form with the data submitted by the user.

### Caveats

<Row>
  <Col>
    If you have more than one form active on the page, you'll need to take some extra steps to ensure
    you don't show errors on the wrong form.
  </Col>
  <Col>
    ```tsx
    const form = useForm({
      validator,
      id: "form-1",
    })

    return (
      <form {...form.getFormProps()}>
        {/* You don't need this part if you're using
          `ValidatedForm` instead of `useForm` */}
        {form.renderFormIdInput()}

        {/* The rest of the form */}
      </form>
    )
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>

### Example

Try disabling JavaScript in your browser to see how server validation errors are handled.

<ServerValidation />

## API differences

The API of `useForm` and `ValidatedForm` are almost identical to the base `@rvf/react` API.
The main difference is that `useForm` can accept many of the props you would normally pass
to `Form` or `useSubmit` from `Remix`. In order for these to work correctly,
you should pass them to the `useForm` hook instead of the `Form` component.

## `form` or `Form`?

Normally, with Remix, you would use the `Form` component for most of your forms.
When using RVF though, you don't need to do that.
`useForm` calls `preventDefault` on the form's submit callback, to take control
of the form submission.
