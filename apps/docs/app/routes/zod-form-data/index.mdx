# zod-form-data

Validation helpers for [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
specifically for parsing `FormData` or `URLSearchParams`.
This is particularly useful when using [remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix)
and combos well with [remix-validated-form](/).

The main goal of this library is deal with the pain point that everything in `FormData` is a string.
Sometimes, properly validating this kind of data requires a lot of extra hoop jumping and preprocessing.
With the helpers in `zod-form-data`, you can write your types closer to how you want to.

## Example

```tsx
import { zfd } from "zod-form-data";

const schema = zfd.formData({
  name: zfd.text(),
  age: zfd.numeric(z.number().min(25).max(50)),
  likesPizza: zfd.checkbox(),
});

// This example is using remix, but it will work
// with any FormData or URLSearchParams
export const action = async ({ request }) => {
  const { name, age, likesPizza } = schema.parse(
    await request.formData()
  );
  // do something with parsed data
};
```

If you're also using `remix-validated-form`, you don't need to use `zfd.formData`,
but it will still work correctly if you do.

```tsx
const validator = withZod(
  zfd.object({
    name: zfd.text(),
    age: zfd.numeric(z.number().min(25).max(50)),
    likesPizza: zfd.checkbox(),
  })
);
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install zod-form-data
```

## Contributing

The eventual goal is to have a helper to preprocess and/or validate most types of native inputs.
If you have a helper for an input type that isn't in this library, feel free to open a PR to add it!
