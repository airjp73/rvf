# Supporting users without JS

This library will support the no-JS use case as long as `remix` does.
However, the way you go about doing this may vary depending on how important this is to you.

## If supporting users without JS is important for you

You should fall back to [native browser validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)
when JS is disabled. This is more work to maintain, but it's a better experience for users.

In order to do this properly, you can pass `noValidate` to your `ValidatedForm` when JS is available.
A helpful tool for doing that is [useHydrated from remix-utils](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-utils#usehydrated).

```tsx
const isHydrated = useHydrated();
return <ValidatedForm noValidate={isHydrated} />;
```

This will allow `remix-validated-form` to take over validation when it can,
but will fall back to native browser validation when it can't.

## If users without JS are an edge-case

The primary mechanism `remix-validated-form` has for supporting users without JS is
the second argument of the `validationError` helper.
This does come with some caveats, which you can read more about in the [validationError docs](/validation-error).

Most of the time your code will look like this:

```tsx
const action: ActionFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  const result = await validator.validate(
    await request.formData()
  );
  if (result.error)
    return validationError(
      result.error,
      result.submittedData
    );
  // do something with result.data
};
```

## Other Considerations

### Using fields outside of a `ValidatedForm` component

If you're using fields outside of the `ValidatedForm` component,
the default values may not correctly populate.
To set default values in a way that works without JS, use [setFormDefaults](/reference/set-form-defaults).
