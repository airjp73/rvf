import { PropHeader } from "~/components/PropHeader";

<PropHeader
  variant="h1"
  prop="useUpdateControlledField"
  type="(formId?: string) => (field: string, value: unknown) => void"
/>

Used to update a value being tracked with [`useControlledValue`](/reference/use-control-field).
This is useful for when you don't want to render every time the value changes,
but still need to be able to change the value.
This hook can also update the value for any field without having to call
the hook multiple times.
