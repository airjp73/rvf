import { PropHeader } from "~/components/PropHeader";

<PropHeader
  variant="h1"
  prop="useFormContext"
  type="(formId?: string) => FormContextValue"
/>

Returns information about the specified form.

## FormContextValue

<PropHeader
  prop="fieldErrors"
  type="Record<string, string>"
/>

Contains all the validation errors in the form.
The keys of the object are the field names and values are the error messages.
If the form contains nested data, the field errors are _not_ nested --
the keys of the object will be the same as the name passed to the input itself.
(e.g. `todos[1].title`)

<PropHeader prop="isValid" type="boolean" />

Whether or not the form valid.

<PropHeader
  prop="clearError"
  type="(...fieldNames: string[]) => void"
/>

Clear the errors from all the specified fields.

<PropHeader prop="clearAllErrors" type="() => void" />

Clears all the errors in the form.

<PropHeader
  prop="validateField"
  type="(fieldName: string) => Promise<string | null>"
/>

Performs validation on the specified field and populates `fieldErrors` if there is an error.
Also returns the error message if there is an error.

This helper will also update errors for other fields in the form depending on the touched state of those fields.

- If another field no longer has an error, it will be cleared automatically.
- If another field's error has changed, it will be updated automatically.
- If another field has a new error, it will only add the error if the field has been touched or the form has already been submitted unsuccessfully.

<PropHeader prop="validate" type="() => ValidationResult" />

Validates the whole form and updates `fieldErrors`.
Also returns the ValidationResult object.
This is the same object you get from `validator.validate` when [validating on the server](/server-validation).

<PropHeader prop="action" type="string | undefined" />

The value of the `action` prop passed to the `ValidatedForm` component.
If no `action` prop is passed, this will be `undefined`.

<PropHeader prop="subaction" type="string | undefined" />

The value of the `subaction` prop passed to the `ValidatedForm` component.
If no `subaction` prop is passed, this will be `undefined`.

<PropHeader prop="isSubmitting" type="boolean" />

Whether or not the form is currently submitting.

<PropHeader prop="hasBeenSubmitted" type="boolean" />

Whether or not a submit has been attempted.
This will be `true` after the first submit attempt, even if the form is invalid.
This resets when the form resets.

<PropHeader
  prop="defaultValues"
  type="Record<string, any>"
/>

The default values of the `ValidatedForm` component.
In cases where the user has javascript disabled,
this can sometimes be something other than what is passed into the `ValidatedForm` directly.

<PropHeader
  prop="touchedFields"
  type="Record<string, boolean>"
/>

Contains all the touched fields.
The keys of the object are the field names and values are whether or not the field has been touched.
If a field has not been touched at all, the value will be `undefined`.
If you set touched to `false` manually, then the value will be `false`.

<PropHeader
  prop="setFieldTouched"
  type="(fieldName: string, touched: boolean) => void"
/>

Manually set the `touched` state of the specified field.

<PropHeader prop="reset" type="() => void" />

Resets the form, setting values back to default
and clearing all errors and touched states..

_Note_: This same behavior can be achieved by calling `reset` on the form element itself
or by clicking a button with `type="reset"`

<PropHeader prop="submit" type="() => void" />

Submits the form, running all validations first.

_Note_: This is equivalent to clicking a button element with `type="submit"` or calling formElement.submit().

<PropHeader prop="getValues" type="() => FormData" />

Returns the current form values as a `FormData` object.
