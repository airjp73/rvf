## Base package

<Row>
  <Col>
    RVF can be used with any flavor of React, but there's also an adapter specifically for [Remix / React Router](https://remix.run).

    - `@rvf/react`
    - `@rvf/react-router`

  </Col>

  <Col>
    <CodeExamples title="Install base package" tabs={["Vanilla React", "React Router"]}>
      ```bash
      npm install @rvf/react
      ```

      ```bash
      npm install @rvf/react-router
      ```
    </CodeExamples>

  </Col>

</Row>

## Validation library adapter

<Row>
  <Col>
    RVF is supports [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) out of the box,
    so you can use any compatible validation library with no adapter.
    Some of these include:

    - Zod
    - Valibot
    - ArkType
    - Effect Schema
    - [And more](https://standardschema.dev/)

    There's also an official adapter for `yup`. Install `@rvf/yup` if you want to use `yup`.
