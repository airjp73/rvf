# Supporting users without JS

If you're using a server-side framework like Remix / React Router, you can use RVF even if JS is disabled in the user's browser.
However, the way you go about doing this may vary depending on how important this is to you.

## If supporting users without JS is important for you

You should fall back to [native browser validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)
when JS is disabled. This is more work to maintain, but it's a better experience for users.

In order to do this properly, you can pass `noValidate` to your form when JS is available.
A helpful tool for doing that is [useHydrated from remix-utils](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-utils#usehydrated).
If you aren't using remix, you can copy the recipe [here](/recipes/use-hydrated).

This will allow RVF to take over validation when it can,
but will fall back to native browser validation when it can't.

If the native HTML api can't handle all of your validation requirements, you'll also want to read the next section.

## If users without JS are an edge-case

<Note>
  This section applies to the plain React adapter. If you're
  using the `useForm` hook from the React Router adapter, read
  about [server-side validation for the remix
  adapter](/remix#server-side-validation).

    If users not having JS enabled is more of an edge case, or you need to handle more complex errors than the native HTML api can handle,
    you'll need to be rendering the form on your server.
    If your form submission contains errors, you can pass those errors to your form using the `serverValidationErrors` option.

    When your page loads the errors from the server will be displayed to the user where they normally would be.

    ```tsx
    const form = useForm({
      // ...other options
      serverValidationErrors: {
        firstName: "First name is required",
        lastName: "Last name is required",
      },
    });
    ```
  </Col>
</Row>

### Persisting the form values

<Row>
  <Col>
    You likely don't want the user to lose their progress in your form if your server validation fails.
    You can handle this by changing what you pass to `defaultValues` when you have server validation errors.
  </Col>
  <Col>
    ```tsx
    const form = useForm({
      // ...other options
      serverValidationErrors: myServerErrors,
      defaultValues: userSubmittedValues ?? regularDefaultValues,
    });
    ```
  </Col>
</Row>
